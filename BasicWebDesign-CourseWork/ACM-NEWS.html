        <h1>Weird creature spotted in a local neighborhood</h1>
        <h2>Erm some context please?</h2>
        <p>Noises have been heard around the yards of many local residents. They claim that its a humanoid like creature that mimics voices. Some residents claim that <q>This is a load of boulder dash and that no such thing actually exists you <b>BRAINLESS APES!</b></q> What do we have to say about this? Well fear not we always come with the worst news possible to keep you on edge and forever paranoid.</p>
        <h2>Please tell me this is boulder dash...! PLEASE!!!</h2>
        <p>Well luckly for you I kind of don't care but to tell you the truth... yes this thing does exist and it won't hesitate to harm you! there have been several calls and reports to local authorities about this human like entity which does seem to pose a threat to the well being of the locals situated there. Since the first sightings of this creature, residents have started dissapering and the numbers just seem to be increasing.</p>
        <h2>What does this mean for us?!</h2> 
        <p>YOU'RE COOKED! ok let me rephrase that. the people over at <b>[CENSORED]</b> county are probably screwed now thats not to say you guys aren't going to live through because (honestly I don't think) you will make it out of this. just keep praying and maybe someone will help you this was John with the news I hope to see you tomorrow.
